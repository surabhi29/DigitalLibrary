###Project Explaination
**Assumption:: the count of indiviual book is 1.
1.)I have used routing therefore, first page displays all books information with 'Maintenance' information because none of the book has a location.
2.)As the location is updated for the selected book the status of the changes from 'Maintenanc' to 'Available' and along which it shows the details of issue history and gives the option of issuing a book.
3.)If the status of the book is already 'Issued' then it gives the option of returning the book.
4.)On click of issue details link a new div gets opened which displays the issue history and location details of the book along with the back option.
5.)Search of the book is implemented.
